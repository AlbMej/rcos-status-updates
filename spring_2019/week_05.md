## Last Week's Accomplishments

> All mock ups are now completed. There are still improvements to be added but a color palette has been chosen. Had a meeting with 
> my team to discuss the direction of the project and the necessary tasks to partake in the coming weeks. 
> Logos are finalized. 

## This Week's Plan

> Still brainstorming a page for profiles and more features for the website. Some of this features include the ability to upload 
> multiple syllabuses. This feature is hard to conceptualize with our current design set up so there might have to be some
> modification.

> My team and I still need is to come up with a copy for the website. Currently most of the pages is filled with lorem ipsum.

> I will start looking into algorithms to parse information from the syllabuses.

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now.
