## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I've started working on the algorithms for the parsing algorithms. As of now, I've found some good libraries to work with. 

## This Week's Plan

> Continue working on the algorithms. Now that I have a good method for parsing the PDFs, I should start looking into how to go about
> anaylzing the information. 

> As always, I will keep the following as reminder of tasks the project will need to address in the future:
> - Continue brainstorming a page for profiles and more features for the website. 
> - Consider feature that when a user uploads a new syllabus, they are given the option to add to an existing calender or a new one. 
> - Come up with a copy for the website. Currently most of the pages is filled with lorem ipsum.

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now.
