## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was able to get the mockups for my front-end team. I met with them to discuss any suggestions they had for the mockups. I 
> supplied them with wireframes for the Homepage (3 versions), Processing Popup, Create an Account Popup, and a View Tasks page.
> I managed to get useful suggestions from my team regarding all the wireframes. 

> I am still overseeing the team structure and creating sprints for the team members. I swapped a person from the front-end with 
> someone from the back-end. I assigned the task of creating the homepage and processing popup to two of the front-end members. 
> Due to the swap, I had the third front-end member start with learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS and the third back-end member 
> with learning Python and Django. 

> I spoke with the other back end member for updates on progress and his given task. I gave some suggestions for the back-end work 
> based on the plan I have for the front-end. 

## This Week's Plan

> I plan on delivering more finalized mockups by Tuesday. Currently, the homepage and processing popup wireframes have the 
> highest priority over the rest of the mockups. I plan on having these delivered first so the front-end team can begin their 
> development. 

> I also plan on looking into the suggestions for the other wireframes. Currently, the View Tasks page is in need of an update 
> surrounding how the tasks are viewed. In addition to that, I have to look into the Create an Account popup and where it should 
> be placed. Based on last weeks discussion with the front-end team, it was agreed that another page should be added so I am tasked 
> with coming up with ideas for that new wireframe. 

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now. Everything is going at an excellent pace.
