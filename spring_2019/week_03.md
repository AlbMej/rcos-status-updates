## Last Week's Accomplishments

> More progress on the View and Edit Tasks page.

> I had considered adjusting my projects mission statement after speaking with some people, including my team. I came to
> the conclusion that my original "all purpose" mission statement is difficult to properly advertise. In turn, it makes many
> of the design decisions difficult as I have to try to capture not only an entire audience, but many different audiences.
> This inevitably lead to a new task for me this week! Yay :). 

> I got a couple logos for my the two potential names of this project. However, they are still in progress. 

> More progress has been made for the 5th homepage mock up. 

## This Week's Plan

> I am going to try send out the last homepage mockup to my team this week. It is the 5th one so we will have a good number
> to decide from. I will continue use the feedback from my team for updates to the View and Edit Tasks page. 

> I am going to try to send out some logo prototypes to my team this week. I have logos for both ScheduleThis and our new 
> potential name, SyllaView. 

> I am brainstorming a new advertising scheme, one more directed towards students instead of professionals in general. It is
> to reduce the confusion within my projects mission statement. 

> Altering my projects mission statement will in hand alter the tone of the website and it's design elements. I will have to 
> consult more on this to accurately portay my mission statement. Also, figuring out an appororiate color palette is another
> task. 

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now.

## Notes

> A name change seems to be a favorable decision within the team. I will garner their feedback on the logos to help my 
> decision. 
> Also, I've had an extremely busy week so providing a status update over the weekend completely slipped my mind. 
> Apologies.
