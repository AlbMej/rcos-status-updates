## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last homepage mockup is closed to being finalized. Very probable that it might be the design we will go with based on the insight 
> from a couple of designers. After extensive research from competitors, a color palette for the project was finally chosen. The
> color palette accurately represents the product, the tone, and the message. Some of the current mockups were updated with this
> color palette. Other homepages were good but I didn't feel that it fit the professional/student message and tone. 

## This Week's Plan

> Being that is spring break, I might start uploading the mock ups on Github instead of showing my teammates in person. 

> Logos are being finalized. View tasks page still needs some improvement. It is currently lacking various features and is still in 
> very early devlopment stage. 

> I am brainstorming a new page for profiles and more features for the website. Some of this features include the ability to upload 
> multiple syllabuses. This feature is hard to conceptualize with our current design set up so there might have to be some
> modification.

> Some other random things that I may do this week or next week. One thing, low on priority, is to come up with a copy for the
> website. Currently most of the pages is filled with lorem ipsum.

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now.

## Notes

> When I get back to campus, I might have Professor Goldschimdt weigh in on our potential name change to see what he thinks. I just 
> like to get multiple opinions on a decision before I go through with it.
