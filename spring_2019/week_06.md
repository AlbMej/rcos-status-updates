## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Continued talks about the remaining mocks (that have to deal with users after they have signed in). Also went over a missing 
> crucial detail about the mocks with my team (If a user has an account, where do they log in? My mocks don't present the ability
> too only to sign up).

> We moved away from the multiple syllabus upload idea for now. We decided it would be best to just have them upload one at a time
> and add it to the same calender. 

## This Week's Plan

> I will list some tasks for myself to remember them (some are still the same from the last status update)
> - Continue brainstorming a page for profiles and more features for the website. 
> - Consider feature that when a user uploads a new syllabus, they are given the option to add to an existing calender or a new one. 
> - My team and I still need is to come up with a copy for the website. Currently most of the pages is filled with lorem ipsum.
> - Continue looking into to parse information from the syllabuses.

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now.
