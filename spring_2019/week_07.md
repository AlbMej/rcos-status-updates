## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I've been pretty busy the past couple of weeks but I started to look more into the algorithms for the parsing of PDFs. 

## This Week's Plan

> I still have some task on the table for my team (some are still the same from the last status updates)
> - Prioritize researching the algorithms and begin implementing them. 
> - Continue brainstorming a page for profiles and more features for the website. 
> - Consider feature that when a user uploads a new syllabus, they are given the option to add to an existing calender or a new one. 
> - Come up with a copy for the website. Currently most of the pages is filled with lorem ipsum.
> - Guide my team on upcoming deadlines and what should take prioity right now for their tasks. The end of the semester is near so everyone is very busy. 

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now.
