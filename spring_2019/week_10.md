## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have implemented a bare bones version of the parsing algorithms. While the production version of the website in still in progress, I made
> a small website with Flask to house the algorithms. Also, while the calendar view is still in progress, I have integrated a Google 
> Calendar into the website. Very much in the prototype phase still but a big jump in progress to say the least. Here are the links to where 
> you can find work related to the project:
> - Syllaview website repo: https://github.com/AlbMej/Syllaview
> - Information Extraction Algorithms: https://github.com/AlbMej/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/Syllabus%20Event%20Extraction%20for%20Google%20Calendar


## Future Plan

> Sorry for submitting this last status update late, I have been terribly busy. Essentially, the only future plans now is to continue working on the parsing algorithms, which I have dubbed DEEFCI. I also have to decide on the future of this project itself. With my team members gone, I question if I have enough time to continue working on this project in the Fall. If I do, I can have the rest of the website built. Until
then, here are the missing stories my team and I could not finish this semester:

> - Continue brainstorming a page for profiles and more features for the website. 
> - Consider feature that when a user uploads a new syllabus, they are given the option to add to an existing calender or a new one. 
> - Come up with a copy for the website. Currently most of the pages is filled with lorem ipsum.

> I now just need to check in with my team mates to talk about things they done and wanted to complete for the project. I could have someone 
> pick up on their work in the future. It was a good semester and I had fun taking this project somewhere!

## Anything Blocking?

> The semester ending. T.T
