## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I began to research ways to anaylze the information in the PDFs. I started using NLP methods, specifically I have been looking into ruled 
> based event extraction. 

## This Week's Plan

> Conitnue working on using NLP methods to gather the information from the PDFs (Or other file types like HTML if time permits). I will have 
> to see how good certain methods are for this project and find a method that I can get working. Although filtering through the PDFs, given 
> the myriad of formats syllabuses can come in, has proven to be a big task in and of itself. 

> As a reminder, here are tasks the project will need to address in the future:
> - Continue brainstorming a page for profiles and more features for the website. 
> - Consider feature that when a user uploads a new syllabus, they are given the option to add to an existing calender or a new one. 
> - Come up with a copy for the website. Currently most of the pages is filled with lorem ipsum.

> - Check in with my team for one last status report. I know they were busy and having some issues on the front-end so progress had been 
> stalled. I will talk to them about their future with the project and anything else they managed to finish before the end of the semester.

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now.
