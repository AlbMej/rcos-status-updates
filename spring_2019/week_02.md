## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I got out more finalized versions of the homepage mockup. These new versions continue to build upon the same homepage
> wireframe version my team selected from last time. I managed to get a very rough draft wireframe for the new page (Edit 
> Tasks page) and update the View Tasks page. I also readjusted the roadmap of the project as well as it's design decisions.
> I scraped the processing pop up wireframe as one of these design decisions.

## This Week's Plan

> With all the new material, I will have to readjust the tasks/sprints for my team; specifically the front-end team. 

> One of the 4 new homepage versions is incomplete so I will provide my teammates with that version once it is finalized. 
> I will also have to make the decision of which design layout fits best for our website, currently our members 
> have different opinions of which of my homepage mockups to go with.

> I will add everyone to the repo so they can commit their code as some of the members have made progress. I will also 
> converse more with my team members to come up with ideas for the rough draft Edit Tasks page. 

## Anything Blocking?

> There are no blockers within the team as of now.

## Notes

> Currently considering a name change to create a more advertisable brand.
